### 1. **Overall Performance**

- **Performance Trends**: Models show improvement in training and test accuracy over epochs, indicating that learning occurs in most experiments. Loss values generally decrease during training.
- **Overfitting/Underfitting**: 
  - Models with smaller regularization parameters (\(l2\_sum\_lambda\) or \(l2\_mul\_lambda\)) tend to generalize better, avoiding overfitting.  
  - Slight overfitting signs observed with large regularization terms (e.g., \(l2\_sum\_lambda=0.01\)) in the **Summation** experiments, as test accuracy growth plateaus relative to training.
  - Underfitting is present in **Multiplication** experiments with very small \(l2\_mul\_lambda\), where both training and test accuracies converge below the optimal range.

---

### 2. **Best Parameters**

#### Key Findings:
- The **Summation** experiment with **\(l2\_sum\_lambda=0.001\)** and **\(l2\_mul\_lambda=0\)** achieved the best overall test accuracy.
- The **Multiplication** experiment with **\(l2\_sum\_lambda=0\)** and **\(l2\_mul\_lambda=0.01\)** yielded excellent results.
- Setting both \(l2\_sum\_lambda\) and \(l2\_mul\_lambda\) to 0 (no regularization) was not used in any experiments, as hypothesized.

#### Top-performing Parameter Combinations:
| Experiment Type | Parameters | Learning Rate (\(lr\)) | Weight Norm (\(wn\)) | Accuracy (%) |
|-----------------|------------|-----------------------|----------------------|--------------|
| Summation       | \(l2\_sum\_lambda=0.001\), \(l2\_mul\_lambda=0\) | 0.01                | 0.9                 | **87.08**    |
| Multiplication  | \(l2\_sum\_lambda=0\), \(l2\_mul\_lambda=0.01\)  | 0.01                | 0.9                 | **86.9**     |

---

### 3. **Experiment Type Analysis**

- **Summation Performance**:  
  The **Summation** experiments achieve slightly higher test accuracy (best: **87.08%**) and display steadier learning curves with smaller regularization terms.
  
- **Multiplication Performance**:  
  While generally robust, the **Multiplication** experiments exhibit variability in loss metrics due to the scaling impact of \(l2\_mul\_lambda\). The test accuracy peaks at **86.9%**, which is slightly lower than the top **Summation** result.

**Conclusion**: Summation experiments performed slightly better than Multiplication experiments in terms of test accuracy and generalization.

### 4. **Top Experiments**

#### Overall Top 3 Experiments:
| Rank | Experiment Type | Parameters                          | Learning Rate (\(lr\)) | Weight Norm (\(wn\)) | Accuracy (%) |
|------|-----------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|--------------|
| 1    | Summation       | \(l2\_sum\_lambda=0.001\), \(l2\_mul\_lambda=0\) | 0.01                | 0.9                 | **87.08**    |
| 2    | Multiplication  | \(l2\_sum\_lambda=0\), \(l2\_mul\_lambda=0.01\)  | 0.01                | 0.9                 | **86.9**     |
| 3    | Summation       | \(l2\_sum\_lambda=0.0001\), \(l2\_mul\_lambda=0\)| 0.01                | 0.9                 | 86.66        |

#### Best Experiment in Each Type:
- **Summation**: Parameters: \(l2\_sum\_lambda=0.001\), \(l2\_mul\_lambda=0\); Accuracy: **87.08%**.
- **Multiplication**: Parameters: \(l2\_sum\_lambda=0\), \(l2\_mul\_lambda=0.01\); Accuracy: **86.9%**.

### 5. **Detailed Insights**

#### Trends and Observations:
1. **Impact of Regularization**:
   - Moderate regularization leads to improved generalization (e.g., \(l2\_sum\_lambda=0.001\) in Summation experiments).
   - Excessively small regularization (e.g., \(l2\_mul\_lambda=0.0001\)) results in slow loss convergence and suboptimal accuracy.

2. **Learning Rate Dependency**:
   - Across all experiments, \(lr=0.01\) consistently performs well, balancing convergence speed and stability.
   
3. **Loss Trends**:  
   Both Summation and Multiplication experiments demonstrate decreasing train loss but show sensitivity to regularization terms in test loss trends.

4. **Weight Normalization (WN)**:  
   Enabling \(wn=0.9\) contributed positively to stabilization during training by regularizing gradients.

---

### 6. **Recommendations**

#### For Future Experiments:
1. **Focus on Moderate Regularization**:
   - Prioritize \(l2\_sum\_lambda \in [0.0001, 0.001]\) for Summation and \(l2\_mul\_lambda \in [0.001, 0.01]\) for Multiplication experiments. Both ranges yield the best generalization performance.

2. **Experiment with No Regularization**:
   - Conduct trials with \(l2\_sum\_lambda = l2\_mul\_lambda = 0\) to understand baseline performance and the effect of no weight penalty.

3. **Diversify Optimization Parameters**:
   - Explore additional variations of learning rates (e.g., \(lr=0.005\)) for improved test-time accuracy.

4. **Increase Model Depth**:  
   - Analyze the effects of deeper architectures to leverage more complex feature extraction capabilities.

5. **Analyze Margin Distributions**:
   - Investigate the margin (mean margin metric) for a deeper understanding of decision boundary behavior across experiments.

By systematically addressing these recommendations, future iterations can achieve greater improvements and uncover additional insights into model dynamics.
