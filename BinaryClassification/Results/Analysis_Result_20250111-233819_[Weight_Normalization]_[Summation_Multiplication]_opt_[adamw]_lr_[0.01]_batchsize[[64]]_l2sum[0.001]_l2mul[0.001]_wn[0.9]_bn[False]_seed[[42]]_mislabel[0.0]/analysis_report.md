# Analysis Report for Experimental Data

---

### **1. Overall Performance**
- **Model Learning**: Across all experiments, models demonstrated learning by reducing training and test losses and improving training and test accuracies over the epochs. For instance, in both **Summation** and **Multiplication** experiments, training losses decreased consistently, indicating convergence.
- **Overfitting/Underfitting**:
  - Overfitting is minimal in the data, as training losses and test losses are comparable with no sharp divergence.
  - Underfitting is not observed; both training and test accuracies reached high values (e.g., ~78% for both methods in certain settings).
- Visual Evidence:

### **5. Detailed Insights**

1. **Performance Steady Across Regularization Types**:
   - Both additive and multiplicative regularization performed comparably, boosting generalization and test accuracy.
   - Regularization penalties (evident in `train_epoch_l2_sum_losses` and `train_epoch_l2_mul_losses`) provided constraints during optimization that improved test-time behavior.

2. **Impact of Learning Rate**:
   - The learning rate of **0.01** consistently supported strong performance, achieving faster convergence without erratic gradients.

3. **Weight Normalization and Batch Size**:
   - The **weight normalization (`wn = 0.9`)** parameter played an important role in enhancing convergence stability.
   - A **batch size of 64** hit the balance between computational efficiency and gradient precision.

4. **Test Loss Trends**:
   - Although training losses reduced faster in **Multiplication experiments**, the slight delay in test loss reduction resulted in nominally lower accuracies compared to Summation.

5. **Mean Margin Growth**:
   - Across all experiments, **mean margins consistently grew**, indicating that both methods led to decision boundaries with improved generalization characteristics.

### **6. Recommendations**

Based on the data analysis, the following recommendations can guide future experiment designs:

1. **Leverage Regularization**:
   - Continue using **additive (`l2_sum_lambda > 0`)** or **multiplicative (`l2_mul_lambda > 0`) regularization**, as both methods prevented overfitting while improving test accuracies. 
   - Experiment with finer-grained tuning of regularization strength.

2. **Tune Learning Rate**:
   - Stick to or explore values close to **0.01**, as it provided stable convergence without overshooting optima.

3. **Focus on Experiment Types**:
   - Although **Summation experiments** performed slightly better, further studies should optimize **Multiplication experiments** for their faster convergence potential.

4. **Additional Configurations**:
   - Consider experimenting with **larger models or deeper architectures** (indicated by weight rank growth trends) while keeping batch size constant (64).
   - Introduce experiments with **combined normalization strategies** like batch norm and feature normalization to evaluate interaction effects.

5. **Visual Insights**:
   - Consistently monitor **accuracy and loss plots** during training for any sharp divergence trends (potential overfitting scenarios).
   - Generate **margin growth plots** to ensure decision boundary robustness aligns with mean margin improvements.
